##DrawBot

I chose to do some research on the application "DrawBot." DrawBot allows you to create 2D graphics using Python. The project was started in 2003 under the name "DesignRobots" for a Python workshop. What's so appealing about this to me is the application's UI which you can view here:

As someone who struggled a lot in the beginning of using Processing, I see DrawBot as a superior alternative for entry level programming. Being able to view sketches in real time allows you visualize the changes being made and better understand what each syntax effects. The syntax was another part I saw appealing for first timers. There  seem to be many more functions to remember, but their names are very straightforward and honest about what they do. DrawBots website has a page dedicated to teaching in schools with this application and it is clear who they're trying to reach.

One of its popular uses from what Iâ€™ve found online is the ability to create and export gifs. DrawBot has a number of extensions you can export as including pdf, svg, png, jpg, jpeg, tiff, bmp and mov, without needing to download any libraries or other add-ons.
