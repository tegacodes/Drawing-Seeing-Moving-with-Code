### 2016 Media Race

This project creates a visual representation for the amount of media coverage each candidate of the 2016 US presidential election receives. The data is pulled from the New York Times API and tracks the names of each candidate. It provides a visualization to compare how well each candidate is doing to the amount they are talked about in the media. The size and velocity of each image is determined by the amount of hits of each names. The input form is to select which date to view but as of now only has a begin date, so the data pulled is from the date you select up until the current date.
