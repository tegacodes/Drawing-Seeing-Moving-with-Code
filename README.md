#Drawing, Seeing && Moving with Code
New media elective at Purchase College.  
Spring, 2016.  
Tega Brain: [tega.brain@purchase.edu](mailto:tega.brain@purchase.edu)  
Room: Location: Humanities - Level 2, lab HUM 1054.  
Office hours: Monday 3pm - 5pm. [Make an appointment.](https://tegabrain.youcanbook.me/)

This intermediate creative coding studio explores techniques for creating dynamic, poetic and interactive artworks in code. Students will learn techniques to program movement, simulate lifelike movement and behaviors, and develop online and offline works that respond to various inputs. Projects will be developed using open source software environments like Processing and p5.js.

###What is p5js?
P5js is a new open source creative coding environment using the javascript programming language. It is a tool that adopts the philosophy and approach of <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> but takes it to the web. It is built by a diverse community of artists, designers and developers and supports the development creative, experimental and interactive projects in the context of the web. Visit the <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5js site here.</a>

##Learning Objectives
Students will:
* Gain skills and experience using open source creative coding environments as a medium for art
* Develop poetic and critical experimental works in software
* Ccritically engage with historic and contemporary computational art practices
* Refine their personal learning strategies, project planning and problem solving skills
